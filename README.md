# Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe!

I have been developing a recipe for my perfect chocolate chip cookies. In doing so, I've been perfecting my ratios of ingredients. For the way I bake, it's easier to determine the ratio, rather than the exact amount, so I wanted a website that will allow me to input the amount of browned butter I want to use, and will tell me how much of the other ingredients I need. This website will do just that!
